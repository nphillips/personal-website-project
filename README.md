# personal-website-project

This repo contains the first draft of my personal website project.

A clean, responsive portfolio website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a professional portfolio with home, portfolio, and about sections.

It features a minimalist design focused on content presentation and responsive layouts without relying on frameworks.

## Viewing the Website

Simply open any of the HTML files in a web browser:

- `index.html` - Homepage
- `portfolio.html` - Portfolio showcase
- `about.html` - About information
